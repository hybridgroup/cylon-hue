# Cylon.js For Hue

Cylon.js (http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics and
physical computing using Node.js

This repository contains the Cylon adaptor/drivers to connect to the [Phillips Hue lighting system](http://meethue.com). It uses the node-hue-api node module (https://github.com/peter-murray/node-hue-api) created by [@peter-murray](https://github.com/peter-murray) thank you!
